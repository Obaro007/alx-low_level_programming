 Bit manipulation

Bit manipulation refers to the process of manipulating individual bits in a binary 
representation of data, typically using bitwise operators in programming languages. 
Bit manipulation is a powerful technique used in various programming scenarios to 
perform operations at the bit level, which can be more efficient and concise than 
using traditional arithmetic operations.

Some common bitwise operators used in bit manipulation are:

AND (&): Performs a bitwise AND operation between two numbers, setting each bit of 
the result to 1 if both corresponding bits in the operands are 1.

OR (|): Performs a bitwise OR operation between two numbers, setting each bit of 
the result to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits in the operands is 1.

XOR (^): Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation between two numbers, 
setting each bit of the result to 1 if the corresponding bits in the operands differ.

NOT (~): Performs a bitwise NOT operation on a single number, flipping all its
 bits (1s become 0s and 0s become 1s).

Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number 
of positions, effectively multiplying the number by 2 raised to the power of the 
shift amount.

Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of 
positions, effectively dividing the number by 2 raised to the power of the shift amount.

Bit manipulation is commonly used in scenarios such as:

Setting or clearing specific bits in a binary representation.
Checking if a specific bit is set or not.
Swapping values without using a temporary variable.
Efficient storage and retrieval of flags and options.
Performing low-level optimizations in algorithms and data structures.
