malloc: The malloc function is used to allocate a block of memory dynamically at runtime. It stands for "memory allocation." It takes the size of the memory block you want to allocate as an argument and returns a pointer to the beginning of the allocated memory block. The syntax of malloc is as follows:
c
Copy code
void* malloc(size_t size);



free: The free function is used to deallocate or release the dynamically allocated memory back to the system. It prevents memory leaks and allows the memory to be reused. The syntax of free is as follows:
c
Copy code
void free(void* ptr);
